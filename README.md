# ðŸ›  backend-projects

Welcome to my backend projects repository! This is a collection of backend applications I've built using various frameworks and technologies. Each project showcases my ability to design scalable APIs, implement authentication, handle complex data models, and integrate third-party services.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This repository contains multiple backend projects, ranging from simple REST APIs to full-featured applications. Each project is structured with clean code, follows best practices, and includes proper documentation.
